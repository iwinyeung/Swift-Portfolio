# Fifty Shades of Colors
Fifty Shades of Colors is my first ever app that displays gradients of red, yellow, and blue when each box is pressed. Though simple, it is an elegant app that uses the NavigationLink feature and vertical, horizonal, and z-direction stacking to demonstrate the use of the storyboard and Xcode features.
