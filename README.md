# MP3 Music Player
An app that plays my top 5 favorite workout songs utilizing the AVFoundation kits and audioPlayer functions in XCode. I designed this app extensively with the @IBOutlet and the @IBAction functions, keeping in mind that each button must be encoded with a unique url to the main path.

# Stop Watch 
A simple timer app that utilizes the overide function, Timer.scheduledTimer function, and a counter to operate a timer. I designed this timer with the goal to start, pause, and reset, while keeping in mind that computers often have a floating number rounding error. I corrected this error by using a simple trick: (10*round(timer) / 10).

# Fifty Shades of Colors
Fifty Shades of Colors is my first ever app that displays gradients of red, yellow, and blue when each box is pressed. Though simple, it is an elegant app that uses the NavigationLink feature and vertical, horizonal, and z-direction stacking to demonstrate the use of the storyboard and Xcode features.
